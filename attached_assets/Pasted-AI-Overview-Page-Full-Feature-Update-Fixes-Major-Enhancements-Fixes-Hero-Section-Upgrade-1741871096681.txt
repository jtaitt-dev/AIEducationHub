ðŸš€ Major Enhancements & Fixes
ðŸŽ¨ Hero Section Upgrade: Animated Background (Three.js)

    Implement a Three.js-based animated background in AIBackground.jsx with a flowing sine wave particle effect inspired by the PSP/PS3 UI.
    Key Features:
        Smooth sine wave motion for particles (not static dots).
        BufferGeometry & PointsMaterial to create a soft PlayStation-style blue glow.
        requestAnimationFrame ensures fluid animation.
        Overlay effect on Home.jsx without interfering with content.
        Fix runtime errors (e.g., [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] acc is undefined).
        Ensure Vite + React compatibility:
            Properly use useEffect for mounting/unmounting.
            Handle WebGL context issues & async state updates.

ðŸŽ› Interactive Particle Customization Panel

    Add a control panel that lets users customize the particle animation settings (e.g., speed, density, glow intensity).
    Ensure the panel is hidden by default, but can be toggled on/off.

ðŸŽ¬ Smooth UX Improvements

    Dynamic Animations:
        Elements fade-in/slide-in with delayed effects for fluid transitions.
        Hover effects: Cards/icons should glow softly when interacted with.
    Typography & Spacing Enhancements:
        Improve readability with better font hierarchy & spacing.
    Infographic-Like Visuals:
        Replace plain text lists with dynamic charts, micro-animations, or icons for better engagement.

ðŸŽ¯ Quiz System Overhaul

âœ… Fixes & Enhancements:

    Fix issue where the previously selected option remains highlighted when moving to the next question.
    Add explanations for correct & incorrect answers (concise and easy to understand).
    Create a Results Page with:
        Personalized feedback based on performance.
        A grade summary (e.g., 80% Correct â€“ "Great job! Keep learning.").
        Learning path recommendations based on answers.
    Increase the time between questions so users can absorb explanations.
    Ensure all "Letâ€™s understand this better" sections show the correct explanation based on user answers.
    Validate that "Recommended Learning Paths" are correctly linked.

ðŸ¤– Quiz Questions (Simple & Digestible)
Question 1: What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

âœ… Options:
A) A type of robot that can think like humans.
B) A branch of computer science that enables machines to learn and make decisions.
C) A physical device that replaces human workers.
D) A new social media platform.

âœ… Correct Answer: B
ðŸ’¡ Explanation: AI is a field of computer science that enables machines to learn, reason, and make decisions based on data. It is used in many industries to automate tasks and improve efficiency.
