    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: {
      correct: "AI is a field of computer science that enables machines to learn, reason, and make decisions based on data. It is used in many industries to automate tasks and improve efficiency.",
      incorrect: "Think of AI as being like a student that learns from examples. Just as a student improves by studying patterns and examples, AI software learns from data to make better decisions over time."

      "By guessing until it gets the right answer",
      "By asking people for advice",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: {
      correct: "AI learns by analyzing large amounts of data and finding patterns. This process is called machine learning (ML), which allows AI to make predictions and improve over time.",
      incorrect: "While humans learn by reading and asking questions, AI learns through data analysis and pattern recognition. It processes information mathematically rather than through human-like comprehension."

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: {
      correct: "Google Maps uses AI to analyze traffic data, predict delays, and suggest the best routes based on real-time conditions. It continuously learns and adapts to changing traffic patterns.",
      incorrect: "While self-checkout machines and coffee makers are automated, they follow fixed programming. True AI, like Google Maps, learns and adapts to changing conditions in real-time."

      "AI can learn and improve on its own, while traditional programs follow fixed rules",
      "AI is slower than traditional programs",
      "AI only works on smartphones",
      "AI replaces all human jobs",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: {
      correct: "Traditional programs follow predefined rules, while AI analyzes data, learns from experience, and improves over time. This makes AI more adaptable and powerful in solving complex problems.",
      incorrect: "AI's key difference is its ability to learn and adapt. Unlike traditional programs that follow fixed rules, AI systems can improve their performance through experience and data analysis."
